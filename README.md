## Overview
This project analyzes a health dataset containing over 100,000 records and 31 features to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes.  
It explores how demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors contribute to diabetes diagnosis.

It investigates:  
- Key predictors such as BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and physical activity  
- Feature selection using ANOVA, Chi-squared, and correlation analysis  
- Logistic Regression model performance after applying under-sampling to balance data

## Files
- `Ekwenibe_Project2.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with analysis, visualizations, and results  
- `diabetes_dataset.csv` — Dataset used for analysis

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering and scaling using Min-Max normalization  
- Logistic Regression model for binary classification  
- Dataset balancing using Random Under-Sampling  
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

## Summary
The Logistic Regression model achieved **84.5% accuracy** with balanced precision, recall, and F1 scores.  
Under-sampling reduced overfitting and improved model generalization.  
The model effectively predicts diabetes based on both health and lifestyle indicators.
